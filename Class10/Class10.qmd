# The PDB Database


```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```


## Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

x <- stats$X.ray
x

as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))

```

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
}
```

```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)

```
```{r}
pdb.data <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdb.data) <- rownames(stats)
pdb.data

```

round(totals)
```{r}
totals <- apply(pdb.data, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```


## Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdb.data[,"Total"] / sum(pdb.data[,"Total"]) *100, 2)

```




## Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

(skip)



## Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

In MolStar, we can't see hydrogens because they are smaller than the resolution.


## Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Yes, it is water number 308. 


## Q6: 

### Here is a lovely figure of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues, the MK1 compound and the all-important water 308. The Asp residues are in ball and stick representation.

# Reading PDB file data in R

## We will use the Bio3D package for structural bioinformatics.


```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")

pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```



## Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198


## Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
MK1, the Merck drug.


## Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2: A and B. 



### We are finishing part 1 today with a calculation…

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```




```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
